Write a solution to find for each date the number of different products sold and their names.
The sold products names for each date should be sorted lexicographically.
Return the result table ordered by sell_date.

select sell_date,count(distinct product) as num_sold,
GROUP_CONCAT(distinct product order by product asc separator ',') AS products
from Activities
group by sell_date
order by sell_date


GROUP_CONCAT() is a MySQL function that combines multiple values into a single string, separated by a delimiter (by default, a comma).

âœ… How Lexical Ordering Happens:
It's because of this part in your query:

sql
Copy
Edit
GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT product **ORDER BY product ASC** SEPARATOR ',')
ORDER BY product ASC tells MySQL to sort the distinct product names in ascending alphabetical order before concatenating them.
