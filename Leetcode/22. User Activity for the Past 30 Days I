Write a solution to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending 2019-07-27 inclusively. 
A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.
Return the result table in any order.

SELECT activity_date AS day, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS active_users
FROM Activity
WHERE (activity_date > "2019-06-27" AND activity_date <= "2019-07-27")
GROUP BY activity_date;
