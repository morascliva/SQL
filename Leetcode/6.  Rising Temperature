Write a solution to find all dates' id with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).
Return the result table in any order

SELECT w1.id 
FROM Weather w1
JOIN Weather w2 
ON DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1
WHERE w1.temperature > w2.temperature;



DATEDIFF(w1.recordDate, w2.recordDate) = 1 â€”
This means:

Match each day's weather (w1) with the previous day (w2), because the date difference is 1.
