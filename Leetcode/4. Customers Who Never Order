Find customers who are in the Customers table, but not in the Orders table.

SELECT c.name AS Customers
FROM Customers AS c
LEFT JOIN Orders AS o 
ON c.id = o.customerId
WHERE o.id IS NULL;


LEFT JOIN:
Get all customers, and add their orders if they exist.
If they don’t have an order, the order columns will be NULL.

WHERE o.id IS NULL:
This filters only the customers who don’t have orders.
