SELECT e1.name AS Employee
FROM Employee e1
JOIN Employee e2 ON e1.managerId = e2.id
WHERE e1.salary > e2.salary;



The manager ID of employee e1 matches the ID of another employee (e2)
e1 represents the employee.
e2 represents their manager.


e1 is each employee
e2 is the employee’s manager — why? because the employee’s managerId (in e1) points to the id (in e2)
