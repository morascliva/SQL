Write a solution to report the first name, last name, city, and state of each person in the Person table. If the address of a personId is not present in the Address table, report null instead.
Return the result table in any order.


SELECT P.firstName, P.lastName, A.city, A.state
FROM Person AS P
LEFT JOIN 
Address AS A
ON P.personId = A.personId


If there is no match, the columns from the Address table will return NULL.
