Write a solution to delete all duplicate emails, keeping only one unique email with the smallest id.
For SQL users, please note that you are supposed to write a DELETE statement and not a SELECT one.


DELETE doesn't support deleting specific columns — it deletes entire rows, not specific fields.

DELETE p1
FROM Person p1
JOIN Person p2
ON p1.email = p2.email 
AND p1.id > p2.id;
