Unknown column 'o.order_date' in 'having clause'
is happening because o.order_date is not accessible in the HAVING clause â€” it should be part of the WHERE clause instead.


select P.product_name,sum(o.unit) as unit
from Products P join Orders o
on P.product_id = o.product_id 
where o.order_date >= '2020-02-01' and  o.order_date <'2020-03-01'
group by P.product_name,P.product_id
having unit >=100
