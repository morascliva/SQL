a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id
→ Ensures we are comparing activities from the same machine.

a1.process_id = a2.process_id
→ Ensures we are comparing the same process instance (start and end must belong to the same process).


❌ Only machine_id:
sql
Copy
Edit
ON a1.machine_id = a2.machine_id
→ This would incorrectly match the start of process 100 with the end of process 101 (same machine but different process).

❌ Only process_id:
sql
Copy
Edit
ON a1.process_id = a2.process_id
→ This would incorrectly match the same process across different machines, which is invalid (e.g., process 100 of machine 1 matched with process 100 of machine 2).
