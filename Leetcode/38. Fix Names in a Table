Write a solution to fix the names so that only the first character is uppercase and the rest are lowercase.
Return the result table ordered by user_id.


SELECT user_id, CONCAT(UPPER(LEFT(name,1)),LOWER(RIGHT(name,LENGTH(name)-1))) AS name
FROM Users
ORDER BY user_id ASC;

LEFT(name, 1) gets the first letter of the name.
RIGHT(name, LENGTH(name) - 1) gets the rest of the name except the first letter.
