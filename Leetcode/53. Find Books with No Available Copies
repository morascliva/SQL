A book is considered currently borrowed if there exists a borrowing record with a NULL return_date
Return the result table ordered by current borrowers in descending order, then by book title in ascending order.

select distinct l.book_id, title, author, genre,publication_year, total_copies as current_borrowers
from library_books l
join borrowing_records using(book_id)
where return_date is null
group by 1
having count(*)=total_copies
order by 6 desc, 2
